This challenge asks us to predict the sale price of houses in Ames, Iowa, based on a set of information provided, such as size, neighborhood, condition, etc.

A real estate agent might be able to do this based on intuition and experience, but a computer – lacking this ability and knowledge – might just accomplish the same. This dataset was compiled by Dean De Cock for use in data science education.

# The Data:
* 81 Columns, each describing a feature of the property like building type, size, no. of fireplaces, neighborhood etc.
* 1460 entries, each corresponding to a house.
